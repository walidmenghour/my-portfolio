            '\n' +
            'Firstly, we built the model. We used the autoencoder model to detect attacks and employed machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, and K-NN for classification based on the type or category of the attack.\n' +
            '\n' +
            'Secondly, we integrated this model into an open-source firewall (pfsense).\n' +
